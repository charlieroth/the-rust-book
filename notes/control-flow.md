# Control Flow

Rust has 3 control flow constructs:

- Conditional branching with `if/else if/else` expressions
- Looping with `loop`, `while` and `for`
- Pattern matching with `match`

The `loop` keyword tells Rust to execute block of code repeatedly forever or until
the program explicitly tells it to stop. Since a `loop` is an expression it can
have a return value.
